#### My app contains many placeholder strings that won't appear in the UI, but I can see them in the Colatris dashboard. How do I prevent these from being translated?

If you're the owner or an admin in the project, go to the _Manage_ page of the Colatris dashboard. From there you can select multiple strings and then press _Mark selected as 'Do not translate'_. Translators will ignore these strings, and they won't be included in the published strings.
