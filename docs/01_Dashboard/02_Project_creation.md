## Projects

After you log in or sign up, You will be taken to the _Projects_ page. It will be empty initially. From here there are 2 options:

* If you are a translator or admin, give your e-mail address to the Project's owner/admin so they can add you to it.
* If you are an app publisher, open the _Projects_ menu in the top left, and choose _New Project_.

## Adding locales

Once you have created a Project for you app, you can request translations by adding locales to it.

On the top right you can see the _Home_ page. On this page, selet the _Project Locales_ tab.
Here you can choose from a wide selection of different locales.

__Note:__ German, for example, will be localized differently for Germany and Switzerland.
