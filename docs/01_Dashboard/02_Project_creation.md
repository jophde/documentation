### Projects

You will be taken to the _Projects_ page. It will be empty initially. From here there are 2 options:

* If you are a translator or admin, give your e-mail address to the Project's owner/admin so they can add you to it.
* If you are an app publisher, press the _New Project_ button in the top right.

### Adding locales

Once you have created a Project for you app, you can request translations by adding locales to it.

On the left you can see the _App info_ tab. Scroll down to the _Supported locales_ section.
Here you can choose from a wide selection of different locales.

Note: German, for example, will be localized differently for Germany and Switzerland.
